## **[TODO]**  
* Select Gesture  (10/25)
    * hand open (Paper)
    * hand close (Rock)
    * index finger open
    * IDLE(if necessary)
    * Bunch finger 
* Collect MP data  
  * hand open ~ bunch finger **landmark angle data**(almost 3200 lines) collected (10/25)
* Try KNN and make it interlock with main program
* Try DNN  
  * select model and layer
  * train
  * make pre-trained model
  * apply into main program  

* Make select page of mode for Data collecting and main program
